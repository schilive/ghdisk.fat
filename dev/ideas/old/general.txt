# Summary

1 - Should have
2 - Great
3 - Good
4 - Interesting
5 - Meh

# Unique features

## 1
1 - Add other input encodings.
2 - Other ways to calculate the FAT type, and a way to specify the FAT type
wanted.
3 - Option to refer to filepaths with "\", where "\" is a filename. This can
actually be exclusive to other MS-DOS FAT versions, actually.
5 - Dry run option.
6 - Set file content with literal (e.g. "--content-literal=love")
7 - Volume ID generated by othter methods.
        A) Time, current and specified.
        B) timestamp human-readable.
8 - Regex and wildcards for reading and deleting files.
9 - Create "--force" for "create_label.txt" to substitute current label.
10 - Unbootable volume flag.
11 - Flag to set "--size" as either the minimum or exact.

## 2
1 - Check for bad blocks, and then maybe also may use a list of bad blocks in
the same format of "mkfs.fat".
2 - Tree?
3 - "help" command, which could also print the glossary.
4 - Short subcommand aliases ("vol" = "volume").

## 3
1 - Set volume size with data size instead of volume size.

## 5
1 - Short options.
2 - Read with offset and truncation.
3 - Reading file directory deepness?

# Patches and Decisions

## 1
- Instead of "delete file" having many filters and options, "read" can be used
  and its output piped to "delete file".
- Filters for reading.

- VFAT: long names, dirty bits, lowercase extension and lowercase name.

## 2
- Environmental variable for the FAT12 image, so "-F" is not needed.
- Environmental variable for the current directory, so "\" is not needed when
  refering to paths.

- Create and update, objects and the volume from host.
- Relative size determination (2x).
- Use same timestamps.
- file's 8dot3name, or generate them?

- Resize without corruption.
- Update internal things without corruption, as FATs, etc.
- Option to resize to file/directory, etc.

## 3
- Default output formats, like JSON, CSV, newline-separated list.

## 4
- Internal fields. Including reading offset, and backup.
- Set and read with hexdump, goold ol' dump.
- Differentiate creation field from display fields.
- Force fields which could still create a quasimodo volume.
- Media byte different for different FATs (e.g. "-mf:0=AA").

- MS-DOS compatibility mode for specific versions. To affect all commands this
  probably should be either a "ymfat12" option and/or an environmental
  variable.
- Option to base volume fields on, like "1.44floppy".
- Atari computers support.

- Use current system date/time to change file/directory timestamps when they
  are interected with, using an environmental variable to default.
- Option to change file/directory timestamps for interactions.
- Use current date on the creation and updates of file entries.

- Select EBPB and BPB data manually, like "sector size", with 3 options:
        1. BPB/EBPB 1.
        2. BPB/EBPB 2.
        3. Manually.
- Select the backup EBPB and BPB on FAT32.
