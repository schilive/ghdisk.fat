# Regular-Header
1. Identify FAT version with different methods; for example, like the FAT
specification X, like Windows driver, like MS-DOS version X, like Linux'
driver.
2. Use an environmental variable to specify the file being handled, the FAT
version identification method, the FAT file being modified, and maybe other
things.
3. For commands that change the volume, make a file describing the changes so
it can be restored.
4. MS-DOS boolotader, and maybe of other OSes, too.
5. Any code in the bootloader.
6. Options "--msdos-volume", to select raw volume, and "--msdos-device", to
select raw device, as a possible substitute of "-f" on MS-DOS/MS-WIN.
7. Kanji support. Somethings were different when Kanji was supported.
8. Edit volume to change geometry and size to fit e.g. a 5" floppy disk image
into a 3" floppy disk. However, also support HDDs.

# A bit Looney
1. Add option/command to find differences between FATs.

# Kinda Looney
1. A "script"-like file interpreted by the program to do the actions proposed.
It would present the actions and the error conditions. This would make so that
file would not have to be reopened lots of times.
2. Add an option for recovery.

# Looney
1. Make a daemon/service to open and make actions on the file.
2. Mount the file image.
3. Make a CLI interpreter that opens the FAT image and takes command from the
user, so they can execute commands.
