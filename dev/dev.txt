# Things to Know Before Developing
## Header Comments
Always write a licence header comment and another, below, at least explaining
the function of that file.

## Documenting
There is a hierarchy of documentation forms, where the lower item assumes
knowledge of the higher item. It is OK to deviate if it is _more readable_
that way.
        - 'dev/structure.txt': explains the project from a high-level view.
        - File-specific header comment. If the file is evidently an
          implementation of another header file, the header file's header
          comment is also assumed.
        - File-, structure- or macro-specific interface comment.
        - File-, structure- or macro-specific implementation comment.

## How to Add an Encoding
To add full support for the encoding X, with N as the normal encoding, do the
following.

1. Decide an internal name which has only letters and numbers, 'x'.
2. On 'encs.h', declare an object for every object type presented in the file,
using 'x' as the internal name. The comments there should help. In relation to
the declaration of the conversion functions, add two functions: one that
converts from 'x' to N, and vice-versa.
3. Implements all these implementable objects declared in the directory where
encoding-specific objects are defined. This should be informed by
'dev/structure.txt'. When implementing the conversion functions, note to
implement the NUL character.

## Important Warnings
- Filenames cannot contain "*", because of a specific way the GNUmakefile is
  used.
- Filenames cannot contain spaces or space-like characters, such as tab. This
  is because GNUmakefile may not deal well with them.
- Every change in the dependencies of include files in the projects, must be
  followed by an update of the requirements graph in GNUmakefile. This kind of
  sucks, but its result is worth it, I thunk. Even if not: THIS IS MY PROJECT!
