# Things to Know Before Developing
## Header Comments
Always write a licence header comment and another, below, at least explaining
the function of that file.

## Documenting
There is a hierarchy of documentation forms, where the lower item assumes
knowledge of the higher item. It is OK to deviate if it is _more readable_
that way.
        - 'dev/structure.txt': explains the project from a high-level view.
        - File-specific header comment. If the file is evidently an
          implementation of another header file, the header file's header
          comment is also assumed.
        - File-, structure- or macro-specific interface comment.
        - File-, structure- or macro-specific implementation comment.
