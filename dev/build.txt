# How to Build the Project
## Introduction
Requirements:
        - Windows (>= Windows 2000) or POSIX-compatible OS.
        - GNU Make; extensions are used.
        - GCC/Clang with at least C89.

To build with default options, use just 'make' or 'make build'. The default
compiler toolchain is GCC, the host OS is auto-detected, and the project is
built on auto-made directory 'build'.

Everything generated by the project is put inside the "build directory", by
default "build". The output executable is located at 'build/$(M_TARGET)' with
executable file extension added at the end.

## Targets
There are two build Makefile targets.
        - 'build' (default): it builds the project with the given options.
        - 'clean': it deletes the build directory.
        - 're': clean and build.


## Options
All build options start with "M_", and are regular Makefile options. So, they
can be set through the Make tool, such as "make M_TARGET=target", or through
an environmental variable.

### File Options
- 'M_TARGET = ghdisk.fat': the name of the output binary executable, not
  including the executable extension, if any. The output of the binary
  executable is '$(M_BUILD_DIR)/$(M_TARGET)$(M_E)'.
- 'M_BUILD_DIR = build': the build directory, created automatically if not
  present. If a non-directory file of the same name exists, an error is
  raised.
- 'M_O = .o': the file extension for an object file.
- 'M_E = .exe | ': the file extension for an executable file.

### OS Options
- 'M_HOST_OS = winnt | posix': the host operating system. It defined what
  tools will be used, such as 'rm' or 'DEL'. If unset, Make attempts to
  auto-detecting it through the Windows NT environmental variable 'OS', and if
  the program 'uname' is available. It verifies the first, first. It defines
  the default value for other options, as well.
- 'M_TARGET_OS = winnt | posix': the target operating system. It defines the
  file extension, such as '.exe'. This is useful in cross-compilation.

### Compiler Options
- 'M_CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89': the compiler options added to
  every issue of the compiler, possibly modified by other options.
- 'M_ACFLAGS': the compiler options added to every issue of the compiler,
  after '$(M_CFLAGS)'. This option is only manually defined, and so is empty
  by default.
